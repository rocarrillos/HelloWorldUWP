# HelloWorldUWP
First UWP app! Credit to Microsoft's Windows Dev Center for a good tutorial.

I've made my first UWP app using a tutorial from Microsoft. I'll play around 
with it for a little to get a better feel for the environment and style, but I
don't think I'll linger long. I have other ideas I want to try out!

When reading the tutorial, I was mildly surprised by how similar the UWP 
development is to Android, except for the fact that Visual Studio is actually 
easy to use and doesn't raise about 23523 errors from built-in files
that you have to hunt down. So far, I like it.
